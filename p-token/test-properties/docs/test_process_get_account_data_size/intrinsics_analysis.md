# Intrinsics Analysis for test_process_get_account_data_size

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive analysis of the SMIR JSON and proof execution traces, the verification of `test_process_get_account_data_size` requires the following intrinsics:

### Required Intrinsics

1. **`raw_eq`** - Critical blocker
   - Used for pointer equality comparison in `accounts[0].owner() != &pinocchio_token_interface::program::ID`
   - Proof stuck at step 94 waiting for this intrinsic implementation
   - Location: entrypoint.rs:1706

2. **`black_box`** - Already present
   - Found in SMIR: `core::hint::black_box`
   - Multiple variants for different types (u64, &[u8], etc.)
   - Used to prevent compiler optimizations during testing

3. **`copy_nonoverlapping`** - Already present
   - Found in SMIR: `core::intrinsics::copy_nonoverlapping`
   - Used for memory operations in unsafe code
   - Has precondition checks

### Intrinsics Found in SMIR

From analysis of p-token.smir.json:

```
Functions using intrinsics:
- _ZN4core10intrinsics19copy_nonoverlapping17h25a99025a5c80754E
- _ZN4core10intrinsics19copy_nonoverlapping18precondition_check17h09044161abc29a35E
- _ZN4core10intrinsics9cold_path17h84b6fff3191f2ef2E
- _ZN4core4hint9black_box17h[various_hashes]E (7 variants)
```

### Missing Intrinsic: raw_eq

The `raw_eq` intrinsic is referenced but not implemented in the K semantics. This is the primary blocker for test completion.

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Test Flow and Intrinsic Usage

```rust
// Line 1692: Mark account as mint
cheatcode_is_mint(&accounts[0]);

// Line 1706: Equality check requiring raw_eq
if accounts[0].owner() != &pinocchio_token_interface::program::ID {
    return Err(ProgramError::IncorrectProgramId.into());
}
```

### 2. Why raw_eq is Needed

The comparison `accounts[0].owner() != &pinocchio_token_interface::program::ID` involves:
- LHS: A pointer returned from `owner()` method
- RHS: A reference to a static constant

Rust compiles this to a `raw_eq` intrinsic call for efficient pointer comparison.

### 3. Proof Execution Trace

From the proof output:
```
Node 21 (leaf, pending)
#execIntrinsic ( symbol ( "raw_eq" ) , operandMove ( place ( ... local: local (
```

The proof reaches the intrinsic call but cannot proceed because `raw_eq` is not defined in the K semantics.

### 4. Impact on Other Tests

Based on tests.md analysis, other tests also require intrinsics:
- `assert_inhabited` - Used in several tests
- Additional comparison operations that may compile to `raw_eq`

## Implementation Requirements

### For raw_eq Implementation

The K semantics need to define:

```k
rule [intrinsic-raw-eq]:
    <k> #execIntrinsic(symbol("raw_eq"), ARGS)
     => #comparePointers(ARGS)
        ...
    </k>
```

Where `#comparePointers` would:
1. Extract the two pointer values
2. Compare their addresses
3. Return boolean result

### Priority

1. **High Priority**: `raw_eq` - Blocks multiple tests
2. **Medium Priority**: `assert_inhabited` - Blocks some tests
3. **Low Priority**: Other intrinsics - Already handled or less critical

## Verification Strategy

Once `raw_eq` is implemented:
1. The test should proceed past step 94
2. Complete the owner comparison
3. Continue to verify the get_account_data_size logic

## Related Issues

1. **Nondeterministic Branching**: Separate issue at node 5 due to symbolic value type uncertainty
2. **Cheatcode Complexity**: Creates highly abstract symbolic values leading to branching

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Implement `raw_eq` intrinsic in mir-semantics
2. **Short-term**: Review and implement other missing intrinsics
3. **Long-term**: Optimize symbolic value handling to reduce branching

## Conclusion

The verification target `test_process_get_account_data_size` primarily requires the `raw_eq` intrinsic to proceed. While other intrinsics like `black_box` and `copy_nonoverlapping` are present in the SMIR, they are already handled or not critical blockers. The implementation of `raw_eq` would unblock this test and potentially several others facing similar comparison operations.
